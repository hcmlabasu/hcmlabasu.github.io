        <h2>HCM Lab</h2>
        <p>The Egypt's first interdisciplinary research lab that targets translational research.</p>
<p>Human Centered Mechatronics Lab applies the findings from basic science and the mechatronic state-of-the-art trends in rehabilitation and assistive technologies to enhance human health and well-being. This interdisciplinary research Lab is in collaboration with academic staff from the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Medicine aiming to design and develop integrated solutions to support and rehabilitate people with disabilities, special needs, and motor impairment and translate these solutions into medical practice. These solutions will be developed using state-of-the-art technologies and mechatronic design approaches to overcome the current limitations with traditional approaches in rehabilitation and assistive devices. 
</p>

<p>The major focus areas of research in the proposed Lab will be biomechanics simulation-based design, microprocessor-based rehabilitation, smart wearable sensors, lower and upper limb prostheses, smart exoskeletons and orthoses, game-based rehabilitation robots, virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation, and assistive mechatronic devices. 
     </p>
     
<h3>HCM Lab is funded by</h3>
<p>The Equipment in Human Centered Mechatronics lab at Ain Shams University is Funded by Science Technology & Innovation Funding Authoriy (Project ID 42885) titled “Establishment of Human Centered Mechatronics Laboratory for Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies”
